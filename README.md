# Geovisualization of Attribute Uncertainty

Geovisualization of attribute uncertainty helps users to recognize underlying processes of spatial data. However, it still lacks an availability of uncertainty visualization tools in a standard GIS environment. This project utilizes two cartographic techniques, choropleth mapping and proportional symbol mapping based on the types of attributes, which is implemented as an extension of ArcGIS (compatiable with ArcGIS 10.x, devloped in MS visual studio 2010, and ArcObject 10.1) 

Specifically, three types of visualization tools are available: overlaid symbols on a choropleth map, coloring properties to a proportional symbol map, and composite symbols.
